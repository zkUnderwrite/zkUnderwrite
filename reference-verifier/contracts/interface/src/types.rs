//! # RISC Zero Receipt Types
//!
//! This module defines the core data structures used for RISC Zero proof
//! verification on Soroban. These types represent the cryptographic proofs and
//! claims that attest to the correct execution of guest programs.
//!
//! ## Type Overview
//!
//! - [`Receipt`]: Complete proof package with seal and claim
//! - [`ReceiptClaim`]: Detailed execution claim including state and exit codes
//!
//! ## Verification Flow
//!
//! 1. The prover executes off-chain, producing a journal (public outputs) and
//!    cryptographic proof
//! 2. A [`Receipt`] is constructed with the seal (proof) and a `claim_digest`
//!    (hash of the [`ReceiptClaim`])
//! 3. The receipt is submitted to a Soroban verifier contract for validation
//! 4. The verifier cryptographically validates that the seal proves the claim

///
/// A receipt is the complete proof package that can be verified on-chain. It
/// combines a cryptographic proof (seal) with a claim about what was executed.
///
/// # Structure
///
/// - **[`seal`](Receipt::seal)**: A zero-knowledge proof attesting to knowledge
///   of a witness for the claim
/// - **[`claim_digest`](Receipt::claim_digest)**: The SHA-256 hash of a
///   [`ReceiptClaim`] struct containing execution details (program ID, journal,
///   exit code, etc.)
///
/// # Important: Claim Digest Validation
///
/// The `claim_digest` field **must** be correctly computed by the caller for
/// verification to have meaningful security guarantees. This is similar to
/// verifying an ECDSA signature where the message hash must be computed
/// correctly.
///
/// For standard successful executions, use:
/// ```ignore
/// let claim = ReceiptClaim::new(&env, image_id, journal_digest);
/// let claim_digest = claim.digest(&env);
/// ```
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// use risc0_verifier_interface::{Receipt, ReceiptClaim, Seal};
///
/// let claim = ReceiptClaim::new(&env, image_id, journal_digest);
/// let receipt = Receipt {
///     seal: seal,
///     claim_digest: claim.digest(&env),

///
/// This structure contains all the details about a program execution that the
/// seal cryptographically proves. It includes the program identifier, execution
/// state, exit status, and outputs.

/// # Fields
///
/// The claim follows RISC Zero's standard structure for zkVM execution:
///
/// - **pre_state_digest**: The image id of the guest program
/// - **post_state_digest**: Final state after execution (fixed constant for
///   successful runs)
/// - **exit_code**: How the program terminated (system and user codes)
/// - **input**: Committed input digest (currently unused, set to zero)
/// - **output**: Digest of the [`Output`] containing journal and assumptions

///

/// standard successful executions, which automatically sets appropriate
/// defaults.
