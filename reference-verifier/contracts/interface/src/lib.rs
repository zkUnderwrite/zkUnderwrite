//! # RISC Zero Verifier Interface
//!
//! This crate defines the standard interface for verifying RISC Zero zkVM
//! receipts on Soroban.
//!
//! ## Core Components
//!
//! - [`Receipt`]: Contains a seal (cryptographic proof) and a claim digest
//! - [`RiscZeroVerifierInterface`]: Verifier contract interface
//! - [`RiscZeroVerifierRouterInterface`]: Router contract interface

/// This trait defines the standard interface that all RISC Zero verifier
/// contracts must implement on Soroban. Currently, only the Groth16 proof
/// system is supported.

    /// Verifies a RISC Zero proof with standard execution parameters.
    ///
    /// This is a convenience method for the common case where a guest program
    /// executes successfully with no special configuration. It constructs
    /// and verifies a receipt claim with the following assumptions:
    ///
    /// - **Input hash**: All zeros (no committed input to the guest program)
    /// - **Exit code**: (SystemExitCode::Halted, 0) indicating successful
    ///   completion
    /// - **Assumptions**: None (the receipt is unconditional and doesn't depend
    ///   on other proofs)
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// - `env`: The Soroban environment providing access to cryptographic
    ///   primitives
    /// - `seal`: The encoded zero-knowledge proof (SNARK) as raw bytes
    /// - `image_id`: A 32-byte identifier uniquely identifying the guest
    ///   program that was executed
    /// - `journal`: The SHA-256 digest of the journal bytes (public outputs
    ///   from the guest program)
    ///
    /// # Verification Process
    ///
    /// 1. Constructs a `ReceiptClaim` using the provided image ID and journal
    ///    digest
    /// 2. Computes the claim digest according to RISC Zero's specification
    /// 3. Verifies the seal is a valid cryptographic proof for this claim
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// Returns `Ok(())` if the verification succeeds, proving that the seal is
    /// a valid cryptographic proof for the given image ID and journal.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Returns an error if any of the following occur:
    /// - [`VerifierError::MalformedSeal`] - The seal is malformed or cannot be
    ///   decoded
    /// - [`VerifierError::InvalidSelector`] - The selector in the seal doesn't
    ///   match this verifier
    /// - [`VerifierError::MalformedPublicInputs`] - The public inputs are
    ///   invalid
    /// - [`VerifierError::InvalidProof`] - The cryptographic verification fails
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```ignore
    /// // Verify a proof from a RISC Zero guest program
    /// verifier.verify(
    ///     &env,
    ///     seal,           // The proof bytes
    ///     image_id,       // Program identifier
    ///     journal_digest, // Hash of public outputs
    /// )?; // Returns Result<(), VerifierError>

    /// Verifies a full RISC Zero receipt with arbitrary claim parameters.
    ///
    /// This method provides complete verification of a receipt, including
    /// validation of the claim digest. Unlike `verify()`, this method
    /// supports receipts with:
    ///
    /// - Custom input commitments
    /// - Non-standard exit codes
    /// - Assumptions (conditional receipts that depend on other proofs)
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// - `env`: The Soroban environment providing access to cryptographic
    ///   primitives
    /// - `receipt`: A complete receipt containing:
    ///   - `seal`: The zero-knowledge proof (SNARK)
    ///   - `claim_digest`: The SHA-256 hash of the `ReceiptClaim` struct
    ///
    /// # Important: Claim Digest Validation
    ///
    /// The `claim_digest` field **must** be correctly computed by the caller.
    /// This is similar to how ECDSA signature verification requires the
    /// message hash to be computed correctly. An incorrect claim digest
    /// will result in verification failure even if the seal itself
    /// is valid.
    ///
    /// Use `ReceiptClaim::new(env, image_id, journal_digest).digest(env)` for
    /// standard successful executions.
    ///
    /// # Verification Process
    ///
    /// 1. Validates the receipt structure
    /// 2. Verifies the seal is a valid cryptographic proof
    /// 3. Ensures the proof corresponds to the claim digest in the receipt
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// Returns `Ok(())` if the verification succeeds, proving that the seal is
    /// a valid cryptographic proof for the claim digest in the receipt.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Returns an error if any of the following occur:
    /// - [`VerifierError::MalformedSeal`] - The seal is malformed or cannot be
    ///   decoded
    /// - [`VerifierError::InvalidSelector`] - The selector in the seal doesn't
