//! # Emergency Stop for RISC Zero Verifiers
//!
//! This crate implements a pausable wrapper around a RISC Zero verifier
//! contract. It provides an immediate, **permanent** kill switch for
//! emergency response to discovered vulnerabilities.
//!
//! ## Design Rationale
//!
//! The emergency stop is **separate from the timelock** by design:
//!
//! - The timelock imposes a delay, which is valuable for governance but
//!   unacceptable for emergency response.
//! - The guardian can pause a verifier **immediately** without waiting.
//! - Once activated, the stop is **permanent** -- there is no unpause function,
//!   preventing an attacker who compromises the guardian key from toggling the
//!   stop.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! In the verification stack the emergency stop sits between the router
//! and the actual verifier:
//!
//! ```text
//! Router --> EmergencyStop (this crate) --> Groth16Verifier
//! ```
//!
//! ## Activation Paths
//!
//! 1. **Guardian call** -- the owner invokes `estop()` directly.
//! 2. **Proof of exploit** -- anyone invokes `estop_with_receipt()` with a
//!    receipt whose `claim_digest` is the zero digest. The receipt is verified
//!    against the underlying verifier to prove the exploit is real.
//!
//! ## After Activation
//!
//! Once paused, all `verify()` and `verify_integrity()` calls revert. The
//! operator should schedule a selector removal via the timelock to tombstone
//! the affected selector in the router.
//!
//! ## Related Crates
//!
//! - [`risc0_interface`] -- trait definition and receipt types
//! - `risc0-router` -- selector-based routing to verifiers
//! - `groth16-verifier` -- production Groth16 verifier
//! - `timelock` -- governance controller for the router
